# Project-Releases
Contains current release versions for all the projects I am working on. Each folder contains a README with a description of what each project is.
There is a sizeable delay between when changes in the project are made and when they will appear in this repository.
To run an application, download the folder which contains the desired project. Once downloaded, unzip the folder and run the application (.exe).
