# Project-Releases
This repository Contains current release versions for all the projects I am working on. 
Each folder contains a README with a description of what each project is.
Code for projects can be found in links in the README of each project.
Not all code is publicly availible.

There is also a sizeable delay between when changes a project are made and when they will appear in this repository.

Each project has either a release verion or a debug version, or both. There is no noticable difference bewteen them, either can be run as you would any other app. To run an application, download the folder which contains the desired project. Once downloaded, unzip the folder and run the application (.exe).
